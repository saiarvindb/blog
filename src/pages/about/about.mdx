I'm Sai Arvind, a Toronto-based programmer with a keen interest in data science, cryptography, and developing user-friendly software.
I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in mathematics.  

On this space, I'll share some of my personal projects and blog about my experiences and insights gained along the way. Keep an eye out for them!
