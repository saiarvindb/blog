# Using TinyTeX in R to Install LaTeX Packages

LaTeX is widely used for creating high-quality documents, and R integrates with LaTeX for rendering R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files or compiling `.tex` documents.  
Instead of installing the full **TeX Live** distribution, you can use **TinyTeX**, a lightweight version that installs only the necessary packages on demand.

## 1. Why Use TinyTeX Instead of TeX Live?

✅ **Minimal installation** – Only installs what you need, saving disk space.  
✅ **Automatic package installation** – Detects and installs missing LaTeX packages on demand.  
✅ **Easy management** – Install, update, and remove packages within R.  
✅ **Cross-platform** – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 2. Installing TinyTeX in R

First, install the `tinytex` package in R:

```r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # Installs TinyTeX (a minimal LaTeX distribution)
```

This installs a lightweight TeX system that can be extended by installing additional LaTeX packages as needed.

## 3. Automatically Installing Required LaTeX Packages

When compiling a `.tex` document or rendering an R Markdown file, **TinyTeX automatically detects and installs missing LaTeX packages**.

For example, if you compile a LaTeX document in R:

```r
tinytex::latexmk("document.tex", engine = "xelatex")
```

TinyTeX will detect missing LaTeX dependencies and install them automatically.
